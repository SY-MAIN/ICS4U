As you open your eyes, the sun shines brightly onto your eyes. 

You feel the ocean breeze that flies through your hair. 

As you vividly try to remember the scene of the great battle between your ship and your foes. 

The last thing you remember was your ship crashing into the enemy ship and you falling off the ship. 

You gaze at your surroundings and stare at the endless vast ocean bestows upon you. 

"Where am I?"  You suddenly notice the wooden platform you were on. 

"FRICCK! Am I stuck in the middle of the ocean on a wooden raft?"
